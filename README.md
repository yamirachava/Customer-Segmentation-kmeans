# Customer-Segmentation-kmeans
This project performs unsupervised customer segmentation using demographic, spending, and marketing engagement data from 2,240 customers. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups and generate business insights to support targeted marketing strategies.

OBJECTIVE:
- Segment customers based on demographics, spending behavior, and marketing engagement.
- Use unsupervised learning to create actionable customer profiles for targeted marketing.

DATA & METHODOLOGY:
- Dataset: 2,240 customer records with demographic, purchase, and campaign-response variables
- Tools: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), Excel, Google Colab
- Techniques used:
  - Data cleaning and feature engineering
  - Standardization of numerical variables
  - K-Means clustering
  - Cluster profiling and comparative analysis
 
KEY FINDINGS:
- Four distinct customer segments emerged with clear income, spending, and responsiveness differences.
- High-income non-parents were the most valuable and responsive segment, while young parents showed low engagement.
- Spending was concentrated in wines and meat products, with lower traction in other categories.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
- Gained hands-on experience with unsupervised clustering and cluster interpretation.
- Developed practical skills in translating data-driven insights into business and marketing strategy.
- Strengthened ability to connect machine learning outputs with real-world decision-making.
